      <h2>Website Evaluation</h2>
      <h3>Good Design</h3>
      <a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/" class="nav-link"><h3>Craigslist.org</h3></a>
      <p>
        Craigslist is an American based classified website in which users can submit postings. 
        The main section of the landing page is divided into sections that include community, 
        services, discussion forums, housing, for sale, jobs, gigs and resumes. Each section 
        is then divided into more specific subsections. These subsection link to listing pages 
        that show individual classifieds. Craigslist features a simple uniform design throughout
        the entire website.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contrast</li>
          <p>
            Each webpage features the same color scheme. The background is off white while headings and menus are placed in grey boxes. 
            The fonts are either colored blue, black, or purple throughout. Links are font color blue until they are clicked 
            then they change to purple. Text that isn't a link is colored black. This contrast of an off white background with blue/black
            text creates a website that is easy to look at for a long period of time.
          </p>
        <li>Repetition</li>
          <p>
            The landing page contains a menu column extending down the left side of the page. The center section contains repeating uniform tables of 
            categories with subcategories. The right most column contains a listing of various cities. This repetition makes finding information
            easy and efficient. The sub pages containing the listings contain another menu column along the left side. The center of the sub page is a
            list of each classified posting headline.
          </p>
        <li>Alignment</li>
          <p>
            The majority of the information on the landing page is aligned within tables in the center of the page. Information is categorized through 
            alignment. The listing sub pages are composed of a menu along the left column. The listings are listed down the center of the page.
          </p>
        <li>Proximity</li>
          <p>
            Related information is shown underneath headings. The landing page's tables consist of a heading with smaller subheadings underneath.
            A user sorts through information by starting at the heading and reading down the page. This connection is repeated throughout the website.
          </p>
      </ul>
      <h3>Bad Design</h3>
      <a href="https://torontocupcake.com/index.html" class="nav-link"><h3>torontocupcake.com</h3></a>
      <p>
        torontocupcake.com is a website for a cupcake restaurant in Toronto. Users are able to learn about the company as well as order cupcakes on the site.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contrast</li>
          <p>
            The website mainly uses a white background with pink graphics and black colored font.The are also several menus with pink backgrounds and white text.
            The pink graphics and white background make the webpage uncomfortable to look at.The menus that use white fonts over pink background are difficult to 
            read.
          </p>
        <li>Repetition</li>
          <p>
            There is a banner of the Toronto Cupcake logo repeating across the top of the page. This banner doesn't look professional and creates a convoluted layout.
            While navigating through sub pages the menu bar changes its position and size.
          </p>
        <li>Alignment</li>
          <p>
            Text on the home page isn't aligned with other similar text. There is a large graphic that extends past the bottom of the page. This hides the information
            located underneath the graphic difficult to find. While you navigate through sub pages information is displayed using different formatting conventions.
          </p>
        <li>Proximity</li>
          <p>
            Elements that are related show no connection to each other. The alignment and font size of the information on the contact sub page varies throughout the page.
          </p>
